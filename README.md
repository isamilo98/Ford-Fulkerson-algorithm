run from the command line and takes a text file as an argument. The vertices are represented from 0 to n.
The two numbers in the first line represent the source and the sink. The two numbers should be separated.
The second line represents the number of vertices.
The other lines represent the edges between the nodes. Eg. If there is an edge of the node 1 to node 2 with a capicity of 5, it is represented like this: 1 2 5.
